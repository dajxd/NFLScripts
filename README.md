# My NFL Scripts

Not yet updated for this upcoming season.

# R Scripts

## Airyards

Generates a chart of average air yards per attempt by team.

## Airyards-epa

Creates a plot of EPA by air yards, split between complete and incomplete passes.

## Third and Long Rushing

Makes a simple chart of rushing percentage on 3rd and 5 (or more) per team.

## Yards By Jersey

Personal favorite, this script takes note whenever a player gains the same amount of yards in a play as their jersey number. The output is ridiculous right now, but it fits how I use it.
