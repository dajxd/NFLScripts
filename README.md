# My NFL Scripts

Not yet updated for this upcoming season.





## R Scripts

*Airyards

Generates a chart of average air yards per attempt by team.

* Airyards-epa

Creates a plot of EPA by air yards, split between complete and incomplete passes.

* Third and Long Rushing

Makes a simple chart of rushing percentage on 3rd and 5 (or more) per team.

* Yards By Jersey

Personal favorite, this script takes note whenever a player gains the same amount of yards in a play as their jersey number. The output is ridiculous right now, but it fits how I use it.




## Python Scripts

* Rosterizer

Probably my most used script. It's a TUI that takes note of which of the day's games haven't ended, and allows me to choose one to see the rosters for. The roster for each team are shown in a split Vim window for easy searching.

* NFL Schedule

This is just a quick pop-up of the week's schedule. I have it bound to Meta+Control+N on my machine, it pops up and then I can dismiss it with a key.
